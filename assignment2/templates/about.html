        </h1>
        <p class="lead">IBM produces and sells computer hardware, middleware and software, and 
         provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. 
         IBM is also a major research organization, holding the record for most annual U.S. patents generated by a business (as of 2021) for 29 consecutive years</p>

    <h1>Info</h1>
    <p>IBM was founded in 1911 in Endicott, New York,as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and
     was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924. IBM is incorporated in New York and has operations in over 170 countries.[7]
     In the 1880s, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of International Business Machines (IBM).
     Julius E. Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885;[10] Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888);
     [11] Herman Hollerith (1860â€“1929) patented the Electric Tabulating Machine;[12] and
     Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record a worker's arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889.
     [13] On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, 
     the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York.
     The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto</p>
    <p>IBM's culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a "sincere" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees,In 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of artificial intelligence when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but "learn" from its own experience. In 1957, the FORTRAN scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the SABRE reservation system for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful Selectric typewriter.</p>
    <p>
    On April 7, 1964, IBM launched the first computer system family,
    the IBM System/360. It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, 
    allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. 
    It was followed by the IBM System/370 in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and
    the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. 
    They and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS/VS1 and MVS, and 
    the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor, 
    had a near-monopoly-level market share and became the thing IBM was most known for during this period.</p>
    <p>
      IBM is one of 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and one of the world's largest employers,
      with over 282,100 employees as of 2022.</p>
